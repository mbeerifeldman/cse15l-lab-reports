entry 665 to see where I logged into ieng account last. Then I used `history !665` to access the entry and pressed
<up> on arrow key to acess the line and used <Crtl-A>  to reach to beginning of the line to delete history with
<right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right> <delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete> <enter>
This prompts a password because I am on my own personal device rather than the computer in the basement that locally stores
my ssh-key allowing me ot log in without password. I enter in password and then click <enter>.
